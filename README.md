### What is the Nimslo?

An experiment to emulate the "Nimslo" camera effect with smartphones. The Nimslo was a stereo camera developed in the
eighties to take 3D photographs that could be lenticularily printed and viewed without glasses. The camera has come back
into fashion in recent years and is e.g. popular on Instagram where the images have been turned into animated gifs. A
good example of this effect can be seen in the video for Mura Masa's
_[What If I Go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLuQ0MGLBXU)_.

### How will the app achieve this effect?

The app allows 2 or more people to link up their smartphones and take a picture at the exact same moment. The app then
uploads the images to a server that combines them into an animated gif that can then be downloaded.

### Setup

Clone the repository and run:

```Shell
yarn
```

Install the Expo XDE or the exp CLI and run the app from there.
